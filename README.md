Predictive Animal Behavior Detection for Road Safety
Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an advanced system that detects animals on roads and predicts whether they are likely to cross, providing timely alerts to minimize collisions. The system employs cutting-edge machine learning techniques using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, integrates sensor data, and processes information in real time to help improve road safety for both human-driven and autonomous vehicles.

The system integrates multiple functionalities including capturing images from cameras (both visible and infrared), optimizing machine learning models for edge devices, and processing real-time data. These features are crucial for ensuring the model works in various road conditions and environments.

Features Explained in Depth
1. Comprehensive Library Imports
This project relies on a variety of libraries for different tasks:

Image Processing: Libraries like OpenCV (cv2) and PIL are used for handling image and video data.
Machine Learning: TensorFlow/Keras is used for creating, training, and optimizing models.
API Development: Flask is used for exposing the functionalities as RESTful APIs.
Utility Libraries: Libraries such as numpy, logging, os, requests, and threading are used for general tasks like handling arrays, file operations, logging information, and making HTTP requests.
2. Image Preprocessing
The load_and_preprocess_data() function is responsible for loading image data from a directory and applying preprocessing techniques that enhance the data quality for training:

Directory Loading: Loads the image data from a given directory (image_dir).
Image Augmentation: Uses ImageDataGenerator to apply transformations like rescaling, shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping. These augmentations prevent overfitting by ensuring the model does not rely on specific features present only in the training set.
Data Splitting: Splits the dataset into training and validation sets, with a validation split of 20%.
Usage:

python
Copy code
train_gen, validation_gen = load_and_preprocess_data('/path/to/images')
Explanation: Call this function by passing the path where your images are stored. The function returns generators for training and validation, which are then used for model training.

3. Capturing Infrared and Thermal Images
The capture_thermal_image() function is used to simulate capturing infrared and thermal images:

Camera Access: Uses cv2.VideoCapture to access a camera connected to the system.
Infrared Simulation: Converts the captured frame into grayscale to simulate an infrared view.
Thermal Image Processing: Uses scipy.ndimage.zoom to reduce the resolution and simulate thermal scaling.
This feature is useful for capturing image data under poor visibility conditions, like at night or during fog.

Usage:

python
Copy code
thermal_image_path = capture_thermal_image()
Explanation: Run this function to capture a thermal image from the camera. The captured frame is saved as thermal_capture.jpg, and its path is returned.

4. Model Optimization for Edge Devices
The optimize_model_for_edge() function is designed to convert a TensorFlow model into a more lightweight format suitable for edge devices:

Conversion to TFLite: Uses tf.lite.TFLiteConverter to convert the model to TensorFlow Lite format.
Optimization for Deployment: This conversion ensures that the model can run efficiently on edge devices like onboard vehicle computers.
Usage:

python
Copy code
optimized_model = optimize_model_for_edge(your_keras_model)
Explanation: Use this function to prepare your model for deployment on resource-constrained devices. The function writes an optimized .tflite model file.

5. Pruning the Model
The prune_model() function reduces the model's complexity by removing weights that have minimal importance:

Pruning with TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit (TFMOT): Uses prune_low_magnitude from TFMOT to reduce model size.
Sparsity Schedule: The pruning is done over a certain schedule (PolynomialDecay), which ensures the model's performance is minimally affected while reducing size.
Usage:

python
Copy code
pruned_model = prune_model(your_keras_model)
Explanation: This function helps create a more efficient version of the model, especially important for real-time applications where latency and computational efficiency are critical.

6. Speech Alerts
The speech_alert() function provides audible warnings for drivers:

Text-to-Speech (TTS): Uses the pyttsx3 library to convert a text message to an audible alert.
In-Car Notification: When the model detects an animal about to cross, an audible alert helps immediately notify the driver, especially if visual indicators are missed.
Usage:

python
Copy code
speech_alert("Warning: Animal ahead!")
Explanation: This function can be called to provide real-time audio feedback to drivers.

7. SMS Alerts with Twilio
The send_sms_alert() function sends an SMS to notify stakeholders or drivers:

Twilio API Integration: Uses Twilioâ€™s REST API to send SMS messages.
Alert Content: Provides a simple but effective way to alert relevant individuals, such as notifying emergency contacts if an animal is detected.
Usage:

python
Copy code
send_sms_alert('+1234567890', "Animal detected ahead. Please be cautious.")
Explanation: You need to configure your Twilio credentials before calling this function. This feature is crucial for remote notifications.

8. Monitoring System Resources
The monitor_system_resources() function provides insight into system performance:

CPU and Memory Usage: Uses psutil to log CPU and memory usage.
Prevent Overload: Ensures that system resources are not overwhelmed during the execution of the model.
Usage:

python
Copy code
monitor_system_resources()
Explanation: This function helps in resource management, especially useful when running resource-heavy operations on edge devices.

9. Building an Advanced Model
The build_model() function builds a custom machine learning model using advanced architectures:

Transfer Learning: Uses pre-trained architectures such as EfficientNetB3, ResNet50, or MobileNetV2.
Model Layers: Adds a series of custom layers like GlobalAveragePooling2D, BatchNormalization, LeakyReLU, and Dropout to create a refined model.
Fine-Tuning: The base model's layers are trainable, allowing for fine-tuning on specific datasets.
Usage:

python
Copy code
model = build_model((300, 300, 3), num_classes=10)
Explanation: Call this function by specifying the input shape and number of output classes to build a deep learning model tailored to detect animals.

10. Real-Time Predictions Using Camera
The /predict_from_camera endpoint allows for real-time prediction:

Capture and Predict: Captures an image from the camera, resizes it, and runs it through the model for predictions.
Logging and Alerts: Logs predictions and generates alerts (speech and SMS) if an animal is detected.
Usage: Send a GET request to /predict_from_camera to trigger the camera and run the prediction.

11. Predicting Animal Behavior from Video Frames
The predict_animal_behavior() function is a core feature for predicting animal movement:

Behavior Prediction with LSTM: Uses pre-trained LSTM models to analyze sequences of frames and predict future behavior.
Sensor Data Integration: Enhances prediction accuracy by integrating data such as animal speed, direction, and environmental conditions.
Usage:

python
Copy code
predicted_label = predict_animal_behavior(frames, sensor_data)
Explanation: Pass a list of frames and optional sensor data for the function to make a prediction. It helps determine whether an animal is likely to cross.

12. Extracting Frames from Video
The extract_frames_from_video() function extracts important frames from video footage:

Frame Sampling: Extracts frames at specific intervals (frame_interval), which helps reduce computational load while preserving critical data.
Preprocessing: Frames are resized to a fixed dimension, normalized, and saved for further analysis.
Usage:

python
Copy code
frames = extract_frames_from_video('video.mp4')
Explanation: Use this function to sample frames from a video. These frames are then fed to the LSTM model for prediction.

13. Combined Safety Decision with Traffic Data
The /combined_safety_decision endpoint integrates animal predictions with traffic data to decide on safety actions:

Real-Time Traffic Data: Fetches real-time traffic conditions from external APIs to contextualize the prediction.
Enhanced Safety Alerts: If the predicted behavior suggests a crossing and traffic density is high, a critical alert is generated.
Usage: Send a POST request to /combined_safety_decision with a video and optional sensor/traffic data.
